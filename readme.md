**1. Introduction**

Welcome to the documentation for our project's architecture. This document aims to provide an in-depth understanding of our project's structural organization and the rationale behind it. It serves as a reference for developers and stakeholders working on this project.

**2. Directory Structure**

Our project's directory structure is organized as follows:

![structure](https://ibb.co/JC8hz1z)

-   `Lib`: This is the top-level directory containing all our project code.

**3. Architecture Overview**

Our project architecture follows a modular and organized structure. Each directory and component has a specific purpose.

-   **Features**: This directory contains modules for distinct project features, ensuring a modular and scalable project structure.

**4. Components**

**4.1 Features**

-   **Purpose**: The Features directory contains modules for different project features, ensuring a modular and scalable project structure.

**4.2 Business Logic**

-   **Purpose**: The Business Logic layer is responsible for handling core application logic and data processing.

**4.2.1 DB**

-   **Purpose**: The DB directory manages the project's database-related operations.

**4.2.1.1 Hive**

-   **Purpose**: Hive is used as the database technology in our project, and this directory contains relevant configurations and scripts.

**4.2.1.2 Hive Generated File**

-   **Purpose**: This file is generated by Hive and plays a role in managing data storage.

**4.2.2 BLoCs**

-   **Purpose**: The BLoCs directory implements the Business Logic Components pattern to manage complex application logic.

**4.2.2.1 BLoC**

-   **Purpose**: BLoC components manage specific business logic within the application.

**4.2.2.2 Event**

-   **Purpose**: Event classes are used to trigger specific actions within BLoCs.

**4.2.2.3 State**

-   **Purpose**: State classes represent the current state of the application within BLoCs.

**4.2.3 Cubits**

-   **Purpose**: The Cubits directory implements the Cubit pattern for state management.

**4.2.3.1 Cubit**

-   **Purpose**: Cubit components handle application state and logic.

**4.2.3.2 State**

-   **Purpose**: State classes within Cubits represent the current state of the application.

**4.3 Data**

-   **Purpose**: The Data layer handles data-related operations, including data sources, repositories, data models, and constants.

**4.3.1 Data Provider**

-   **Purpose**: The Data Provider handles interactions with external data sources.

**4.3.2 Repository**

-   **Purpose**: The Repository abstracts data access and provides a clean API for accessing data.

**4.3.3 Data Models**

-   **Purpose**: Data Models represent structured data within the application.

**4.3.4 Helper Constant File**

-   **Purpose**: This file contains commonly used constants within the data layer.

**4.4 Presentation**

-   **Purpose**: The Presentation layer focuses on UI-related components, screens, components/widgets, and presentation constants.

**4.4.1 Screens**

-   **Purpose**: Screens represent different user interfaces within the application.

**4.4.2 Components**

-   **Purpose**: Components represent reusable UI elements or widgets.

**4.4.3 Helper Constants**

-   **Purpose**: This file contains commonly used constants within the presentation layer.

**5. Conclusion**

In conclusion, our project architecture is designed to be modular, organized, and scalable. Each component and directory has a clear purpose, making it easier for developers to work on specific areas of the project. This documentation serves as a reference for understanding the project's structural organization and can be valuable for current and future team members.
